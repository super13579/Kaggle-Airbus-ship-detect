Kaggle- AirBus Ship detect (Unet)

This is Kaggle Airbus Ship detection Chanllenge

Share my experience of this competitions (But I don't get a good grade...)

Step 1 ==> Ship exist detection by Transfer learning of ResNet50  
https://www.kaggle.com/super13579/simple-transfer-learning-detect-ship-exist-keras  
Step 2 ==> ResNet34 + Unet to do Image Segmentation

Step 3 ==> Use Step 1 to separate Non_ship and ship then do Step 2 on Ship Images
